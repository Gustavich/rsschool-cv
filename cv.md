### About me:
I'm 23 years old. In my age I have no education exept 11 classes of school and was awarded a silver medal. I worked on position of call-center operator for 2.5 years and now I work as a computer operator for last 2.5 years. My work includes monitoring operations with site of our company and communication with our programming team, so I really interested in learning JS/FE to recieve an offer to a better vacancy in my company or in another one. Because of my working expirience I think that i can call myself really stress-resistant and hardworking person. So I belive that my learning now will help me with my future ambitions.
